        <h2>About the Conference</h2>

        <p><strong>When:</strong> December 6, 2025</p>

        <p><strong>Where:</strong> University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN (to be finalized)</p>

        <p>
            The first DevFestMN was in 2014 and is organized by GDG Twin Cities, a group of Google
            Developer practitioners and enthusiasts. The conference draws many of the best
            technologists from our region, as well as many Google employees who attend and present.
            This year we expect to have over 250 attendees join the event and share the experience.
        </p>

        <h2>What We're Looking For</h2>

        <p>
            We're always seeking a diverse mix of content and speakers for this community
            conference. Most sessions at DevFestMN are technical, but we're also interested in
            submissions that discuss non-technical topics relevant to technology practitioners.
            Ultimately, we're looking for speakers who have something interesting to say and are
            excited to share their knowledge with others.
        </p>

        <p>
            We welcome speakers of all experience levels, including those who have never presented
            before at a conference.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you're looking for inspiration or examples of the type of content that would be a
            good fit for DevFestMN, please check out the sample topics at the end of this CFP or
            explore our past session

        </p>

        <h2>Why You Should Present and How We Can Help</h2>

        <p>
            DevFestMN is an opportunity to present to a friendly and engaged audience. This is a
            great way for you to share your passion, increase the strength of your network and
            advance your career.
        </p>

        <p>Additionally, we've compiled some resources here that you may find helpful:</p>

        <p>
            If you need practice giving talks, get in touch, and we can connect you with local
            groups who may be seeking presenters.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you have a specific question that isn't answered in those resources and you can't
            make either of the Hangout sessions listed above, shoot us an email: info&#64;devfest.mn
            (just don't use this to submit a proposal).
        </p>

        <h2>Session Length</h2>

        <p>
            Most sessions are 20-45 minutes in length. If you want to leave time for questions and
            discussion at the end (completely optional), plan your presentation accordingly. We'll
            also be organizing some sessions for 10 minute lightning talks and we're open to
            considering a few 90 minute Codelab style sessions.
        </p>

        <h2>Guide for Speakers</h2>

        <p>
            Our attendees come to learn, so we'll want you to shy away from sales pitches and
            anything that sounds like advertising. We welcome you presenting work you've done as
            long as it's informational and instructive.
        </p>

        <p>
            All talks will be recorded and published on the internet for free, along with a
            recording of the slide deck, live-demo or other on-presenter-screen activity. We do this
            for the benefit of the larger GDG and tech community, and those who can't make it to the
            conference. We hope you want to help out, but if you are in any way uncomfortable, let
            us know and we will work things out.
        </p>

        <p>
            We will ask to see your slides in advance of the conference to ensure the content is a
            good fit for our audience.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Submit</h2>

        <p>
            Our best advice is to keep your submission short and sweet. We won't impose a limit on
            length, but we suggest that it be no longer than 250 words. Engaging titles and
            descriptions tend to attract more attendees to your session, so we recommend spending
            some time fine-tuning this portion.
